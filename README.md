# Recall Roadmapper

> A strategic visual roadmapping tool that uses orbital physics to represent confidence levels

## 🎯 Overview

Recall Roadmapper reimagines how teams visualize and communicate strategy. Instead of traditional Gantt charts or Kanban boards, we use a spatial canvas where goals are gravitational centers and solutions orbit them at distances representing our confidence levels.

## ✨ Core Features

- **Orbital Confidence Visualization** - Solutions orbit goals at distances that represent confidence (0-100%)
- **Semantic Zoom** - Three levels of detail: Strategic overview, tactical planning, and implementation details
- **Decision Logging** - Every state change captures the "why" behind decisions
- **Local-First** - Works entirely in your browser, no account needed (MVP)
- **Export & Share** - Export to PNG or share roadmaps via URL

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/recall/roadmapper.git
cd roadmapper

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
```

## 📋 Development Phases

### Phase 1-3: MVP (3 weeks) ✅
- Core canvas with orbital physics
- Goal and solution management
- Semantic zoom
- Local storage
- Export functionality

### Phase 4-5: Enhanced (If validated)
- Cloud persistence
- Basic sharing
- Simple authentication

### Phase 6+: Enterprise
- Real-time collaboration
- SSO/SAML
- Team workspaces
- Linear integration

## 🛠 Tech Stack

**MVP Stack (Current):**
- React 18 + TypeScript
- Pixi.js (Canvas rendering)
- Zustand (State management)
- Tailwind CSS
- Vite
